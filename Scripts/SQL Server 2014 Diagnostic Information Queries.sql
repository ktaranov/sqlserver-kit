-- Please listen to my Pluralsight courses

-- Many of these queries will not work if you have databases in 80 compatibility mode
-- Please make sure you are using the correct version of these diagnostic queries for your version of SQL Server
-- This should not be an issue in SQL Server 2014, since 80 compatibility mode is not supported

-- to the Windows Power Plan or hardware power management

-- You can use CPU-Z to get your actual CPU core speed and a lot of other useful information
