	SP for rebuilding, reorging indexes and updating statistics
	
	SQL 2005 or greater

		VERSION HISTORY:
		Version 1.0
			19 Aug 2010

		Version 1.01
			Added fragmentation before -- Fragmentation after is too resource instensive, and should be close to zero
			31 Aug 2010

		Version 1.2
			Added UpdateStats option
			Added elapsed time on a database level
			Check for the existance of the index (to allow for dropped indexes that were dropped after the start of the SP)
				This allows to a maintenance window on a database where the index may no longer exist after the indexes for defragmentation were chosen
				Obviously some indexes can take a long time to rebuild/org, so there is the possibility that not all the chosen indexes remain in the
				databases at the time of execution
			Checks for read-only and off-line databases
			Checks for the database being principal in a mirror (mirror's can not change recovery model)
			Checks for 2005 or later -(90)- compatibility level (2000 compatibility DB's [on a 2005/2008 server] don't support the use of DMV's)
			Exclude TempDB and Model
			21 Sept 2010

		Version 1.21
			Resolved issue with blank DB Name -- I'm uncertain how @DBName is blank, but the SP no longer executes a statement that will error out.
				--It may be an issue with the cursor going past the last database
			Added page count to display the number of pages in the index
			Minor formatting changes
			21 Oct 2010

		Version 1.22
			Added @ExecAlter -- This flag will determine if the SP executes the statements or just prints them
			Resolved further issues with the blank @DBName returned in cursor
			29 Nov 2010

		Version 1.3
			Added option for updating stats only (no re-indexing)
			Added option for resampling stats
			Minor formatting changes
			Added check for database currently being restored
			Added database exclusion for upto three databases (the code can be modified to offer any number)
			Added verification that the database exists, is online, and is updatable for cases when *all* databases are being reindexed
			Displays total execution time for the entire SP; not just the individual components
			Created check for database name = 'all'
			Displays information concerning the details of the SP (create/modify)
			Added exclusion for msdb, DBAdmin, and AuditDB (now exclude all system DB's)
			25 Feb 2011

		Version 1.31
			Fixed bug with Enterprise Edition 64-bit
			15 Mar 2011 {The foreboding Ides of the month of March}

		Version 1.32
			Added Try/Catch to the execution of the rebuild/re-org
				*Catches indexes that cannot be built online (Only caught when executed, will not work for non-execution [@Exec = false] mode)
			Effective detection on BLOB
			25 Apr 2011

		Version 1.4
			Added catch for single_user databases, as the reindex SP is not guarenteed to be the single_user, therefore excluded
			Removed MSDB from exclusion
			Added date/time to alter index statement
			Fixed spelling error with @ParititionNum, now partitions (>= 2) execute
			Removed fillfactor for partitioned indexes, removed sort in TempDB, forced partitions to re-org
				'fillfactor' is not a recognized ALTER INDEX REBUILD PARTITION option.
			Added option for all database in simple recovery model
			Added Unhandled Error count
			Added @Wait
			02 Jun 2011

		Version 1.41
			Removed option for all database in simple recovery model
			Listed out all 80 or earlier compatibility databases
			15 Aug 2011

		Version 1.42
			Displays Handled Errors in addition to Unhandled Errors
			Uses IsGUID function to not defrag DB's with GUID's in name (errors in object name appear if a GUID is in the DB name)
				Requires the function IsGUID to run
				Function available at http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/mladenp/archive/2005/08/16/7545.aspx
				**Basically, if a DB name ends in a GUID (like many sharepoint related DB's), there is something in my
					logic that is causing both the Schema Name and the Object Name to be returned as null.  This problem
					does not appear to be releated to hyphens in the database name.  Yes, the errors are always hyphens,
					but I have tested by restore anothe database with several underscores and changing them to hyphens,
					the database defragged nicely with the hyphens and the underscores.  This problem seems solely related
					to damned GUIDs.  To hell with sharepoint!
			10 Oct 2011

		Version 1.43
			Fixed the cursor name typo that lists out SQL2000 databases
			08 Nov 2011

		Version 1.44
			Check for bracked DB Names in input parameters, SSMS 2012 adds brackets if db names are dragged/dropped
			07 Dec 2011

		Version 1.45
			Fixes Error 1943 -- "The index <Name> on table <Table> cannot be reorganized because page level locking is disabled."
				Results in ignoring index
			08 Dec 2011

		Version 1.46
			Asthetic Improvements
			10 May 2012

		Version 1.47
			Changed online rebuilds for SQL 2005 Developers Editions (not a supported feature)
			29 May 2012

		Version 1.48
			Added handling for errors:
				9002: The transaction log for database 'XXX' is full.
				1101: Could not allocate a new page for database 'XXX' because of insufficient disk space in filegroup 'XXX'.
			26 Jul 2012

		Version 1.49
			Fixed GUID error (sort of, at least got the SP to skip the GUID DB and move on to the next DB)
			Trapped for error:
				1088: Cannot find the object "SharePoint_AdminContent_462fed6b-f17c-4d00-8c46-b1d01a728fae.dbo.sysssislog" because it does not exist or you do not have permissions.
			Commented out section of code dealing with GUID's
			07 Aug 2012

		Version 1.50
			Added handling for columnstore indexes (error 35352), columnstore indexes are new to SQL 2012.  This error handling
				does not effect functionality with SQL 2005/2008.  If a table contains a columnstore index at all, no online
				operations may be performed on any other index on the table, therefore, online must be set to off.
			15 Aug 2012

		Version 1.51
			Fixed error where if database name had a space in it the SP would ungracefully exit with an error.  DB Names should not have spaces, that's what underscores are for, but some apparently do have spaces.
			Included print @ErrorTxt for DB's that are offline, read-only, single user.  This should have been printed before, oversight on my part.
			Checked to see if cursor's are open.

		Parameters:
			@DB = Either 'All' or the name of a single DB.  If 'All' all databases on the server are examined; otherwise the name of a single DB.
			@Exclude = One databases to exclude; by default master, model, and TempDB are already excluded.  Default is NULL.
				Primarily used in conjunction with all for @DB.  Supports one database.
			@Exclude2 = One databases to exclude; by default master, model, and TempDB are already excluded.  Default is NULL.
				Primarily used in conjunction with all for @DB.  Supports one database.
			@Exclude3 = One databases to exclude; by default master, model, and TempDB are already excluded.  Default is NULL.
				Primarily used in conjunction with all for @DB.  Supports one database.
				***NB: For @Exlude[n], this does *not* have to be a valid database name and there are no checks to indicate that the database does not exist
			@Stats = Statistical Sampling Method (Limited, Sampled, or Detailed) for determining what index will be impacted.
				--LIMITED - It is the fastest mode and scans the smallest number of pages. 
						For an index, only the parent-level pages of the B-tree (that is, the pages above the leaf level) are scanned
				--SAMPLED - It returns statistics based on a 1 percent sample of all the pages in the index or heap. 
						If the index or heap has fewer than 10,000 pages, DETAILED mode is used instead of SAMPLED.
				--DETAILED - It scans all pages and returns all statistics.
			@MinPageCount = Since index with few pages usually don't defrag (and a table scan is preferred), ignores small indexes
			@MaxPageCount = Maximum number of index pages to be considered.  This can preclude very large indexes
			@Fill Factor = Specifies a percentage that indicates how full the Database Engine should make the leaf level of each index page 
				during index creation or alteration. fillfactor must be an integer value from 1 to 100. The default is 0.
			@PAD_Index = The percentage of free space that is specified by FILLFACTOR is applied to the intermediate-level pages of the index. 
				If FILLFACTOR is not specified at the same time PAD_INDEX is set to ON, the fill factor value stored in sys.indexes is used.
			@SortInTempDB = The intermediate sort results that are used to build the index are stored in tempdb. 
				If tempdb is on a different set of disks than the user database, this may reduce the time needed to create an index. 
				However, this increases the amount of disk space that is used during the index build.
			@OnlineReq = Online rebuild (sometimes slower), for editions that support online rebuild (for editions that do not support online rebuild, this is ignored)
			@ReBuildTheshold = The threshold for deciding to rebuild v reorg (MSFT recommend's 30)
			@ReOrgThreshold = The threshold for deciding to rebuild v reorg (MSFT recommend's 5)
			@MaxFrag = The maximum amount of fragmentation to defrag (i.e. if you don't want to defrag an index over 80%)
			@ChangeRecoveryModel = Set's the DB's in simple recovery mode prior to starting, reverts back to original mode on completion.
				NB: Is ignored if @ExecAlter = 'false'
			@UpdateStats = Will update statistics for DB where needed
			@ResampleStats = Determines if stats will be resampled
			@UpdateStatsOnly = Will not alter indexes, will just update stats.  The only other parameters that are used is @DB and @ExecAlter;
				however, all other parameters are parsed for validity, even though they are not in use.
			@Wait = Wait time (in seconds) between alter index statements; allows the server and tran logs to catch up
			@ExecAlter = Will execute the alter statement statement and/or update stats SP -- similar to debug mode

			NB:
			@Fill_Factor, @PAD_Index will only be applied to index that are rebuilt (Fragmentation >= @ReBuildTheshold)
			***There is a possible issue with database names containing GUID's***

			Unfortunatly, I would prefer to simply have one @Exclude, but creating the dynamic SQL would cause more errors than the added
				functionality would enhance.

			It is recommended that as part of a job, you create an appended text file output for this SP.  It provides detailed information
				and is useful in troubleshooting any bugs.  The @WHiteSpace that is appended for most output is designed to hide
				the "[SQLSTATE 01000]" that appears at the end of all lines of text outputs of SQL Server Agent Jobs.
